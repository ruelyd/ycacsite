Equally impressive are the local and internationally inspired seasonal buffets, held outside beside the lawn Bowling Greens during the warm season. The restaurant is named in honor of the Club’s founder, James Pender Mollison, The all-day restaurant boasts a casual atmosphere and first-class friendly service.</p>
