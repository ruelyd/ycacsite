                    <p>The children of YC&AC members attend a variety of Japanese and international schools in Yokohama and Tokyo. Historically, YC&AC has enjoyed particularly close relationships with two neighbor schools, renowned internationally for their quality of education:</p> 
                    <p>Saint Maur International School – “Established in 1872, as innovators of international education in Japan, the school continues to meet the needs of children (co-educational, 2½ years to Grade 12) from the multi-cultural, multi-faith international community.” – <a href="https://www.stmaur.ac.jp/?wssl=1"> http://www.stmaur.ac.jp/</a></p> 
                    <p>Yokohama International School – When its doors opened for the first day of class in 1924, it was the second school to have adopted “international” in its name, following the International School of Geneva. It has since earned high accolades for its excellence in academia. – <a href="http://www.yis.ac.jp/"> http://www.yis.ac.jp/</a></p>
